# Advanced_Spark_Programming

It was great fun to run advanced spark program for processing batch data with my favorite language - JAVA. The fundamental data structure of Spark - <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/api/java/org/apache/spark/api/java/JavaRDD.html" class="button">Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)</a> was basis of all data transformation. Table down below lists the key concepts focused.
